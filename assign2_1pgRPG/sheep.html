                    <h2>Discussion of the System</h2>
                    <p>
                        With my system, I wanted to express the difficulty of stopping a conspiracy in an insulated community. 
                        It’s a player to player to rules system, but whether it is collaborative or not is up to the players. 
                        Shutting down the conspiracy is hard to do unless players work together. On the other hand, if players 
                        are opposed, those who choose to spread the rumor are at a natural advantage. A success on quieting the 
                        conspiracy only decreases the herd’s belief by 1 while a success on spreading the conspiracy increases 
                        the herd’s belief by 2. However, if players they work together towards either end, they can then add their 
                        rolls together and have a higher chance of success overall.
                        <br><br>
                        Players can also choose to directly persuade other players’ characters. This action exists narratively as a 
                        conversation between those two player’s characters, but the result of that conversation is decided mechanically 
                        through dice. Depending on the result and conditions of the roll, players' beliefs become more aligned or more 
                        disparate. This can help or hinder other players, depending on the situation. Players can also choose to 
                        manually manipulate their beliefs by self-reflecting. This narratively reveals something about their intentions 
                        to the other players, but is mechanically powerful in that it’s the only way to manipulate their own beliefs 
                        without randomness. Over the course of the game, players balance mechanically changing beliefs and narratively 
                        persuading other players to help them.
                        <br><br>
                        Outside of the numbers, the main narrative rule is what is said is true and it is implied that players should 
                        ‘yes, and’ each other. The only things that need to be agreed on out of game are about the nature of the conspiracy, 
                        so everyone has some initial pieces to work from. From there, players’ numbers, the number representing the herd, 
                        and players’ previous statements form the basis of whatever narrative the players want to tell. While players could 
                        ignore the interpretive work to be done and treat the system as a numbers game, I have heavily implied the message 
                        I’m trying to impart through the theming and visual design of the game.
                        <br><br>
                        After playtesting, I made several changes to the system. At first, the player’s number represented their own 
                        conviction or belief in the conspiracy at play. This wasn’t clear and in the game, it more so represented the 
                        player’s sway over the herd or how much they were benefiting from the conspiracy being spread. Therefore, I changed 
                        the number to represent the player characters’ perceived beliefs. I also added a small section for defining each 
                        player’s character, which was another aspect that came up naturally in the playtest. Finally, I changed how much the 
                        ‘Orating to the Herd’ action changed the herd’s conviction, so the herd’s conviction didn’t go back and forth as much 
                        and the game would end quicker.
