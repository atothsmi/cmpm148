                    Hi! My name is Alia Toth-Smith.
                    I'm 21 years old and an Art and Design: Games and Playable Media Major at
                    University of California, Santa Cruz.

                    This website stores a bunch of interactive narratives that I made during Spring of 2023
                    to practice working with different structures and tools.
                </p>
