                        Hi! My name is Alia Toth-Smith.
                        I'm 21 years old and an Art and Design: Games and Playable Media Major at
                        University of California, Santa Cruz.
    
                        This website stores a bunch of interactive narratives that I made during Spring of 2023
                        to practice working with different structures and tools.
