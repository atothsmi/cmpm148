                <h2>Instructions</h2>
                <p>
                    Players: 2 or more
                    <br><br>
                    Introduction: Every night at midnight you have been plagued by visions of an odd shop and 
                    the thing that runs it. One such vision traps you unless you play its game 
                    and solve its puzzle.
                    <br><br>
                    Goal: Figure out what time the shop's owner will return before they return. They will return after a fixed number of guesses.
                    <br><br>
                    Set-Up: Click the 'And then...' button below to generate a shop description.
                    <br><br>
                    
                    Play: Take turns guessing what time the shop's owner will return by entering a time 
                    in "The time is now:" and clicking "The time shifts..."
                    <br><br>
                    Note: Whether you enter your guess in 24hr or 12hr time, is based on your personal settings. Regardless, your guess will be 
                    automatically converted to 24hr time and printed out in the "The time was:" section.
                    <br><br>
                    You can use items to help you. Items will either tell you if the hour (0-23) or the minute (0-59) 
                    of your guess is equal to, greater than, or less than the correct time. However, each item only 
                    works within a certain time range. Use the descriptions of what changes after the clock ticks to 
                    figure out the ranges. Pay attention to the feedback below your guess to determine if you've used 
                    the item in the correct range.
                    <br><br>
                    You gain items by completing challenges. A challenge is generated every time you make a guess. If you 
                    successfully complete or win the challenge, you get the item generated. You can use that item once before 
                    it is exhausted. The item is not considered used if it returns to your hands. Every player should keep 
                    track of the items they have.
                    <br><br>
                    You can use the item that the shop sells as many times as you want. For example if the shop that is 
                    generated is “an oil lamp shop”, you can use “oil lamp” as many times as you like.
                    <br><br>
                    Note: Items are case and space sensitive. Be sure to mind spaces and use the singular for shop items.
