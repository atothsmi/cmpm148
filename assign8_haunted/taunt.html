                There was great famine everywhere for the fields watered with blood only grew sickly veins that did nothing to sate our hunger, and blood was all we had left. The Moon had left the seas at perpetual high tide and sucked the water out of the land. 
            </span>
            <span class='span' id="s2" >
                A few chased the tide hoping to drown themselves in the only remnant of our old reality before they realized the Moon was taunting them. For every step forward they took, the tide took two back, ever just out of reach. No one could die of typical means anymore.
            </span>
            <span class='span' id="s3" >
                The only way out of this hell was the forest and those not strong enough to walk withered to skin and bone then rotted to putrid flesh, but they never died. No, that mercy would be too much.
