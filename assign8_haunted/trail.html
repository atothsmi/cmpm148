                What mother wouldnâ€™t want to protect her children from the horrors that surrounded them in the only way she knew how? So I suggested to him that fighting back and risking death might be preferable to continuing in a state like this. Another sleepless night of waking nightmares was enough to convince him of it too.

                We left a note for the children promising to return and set out into the woods axes in hand that very next morning, heavy of heart and trembling under the weight of our decision. Blood rain coated the back of our necks as we walked into the forest.
            </span>
            <span class='span' id="s3" >
                It made our cloaks heavy with clots, but we trudged forward nonetheless cutting through the thickets and slicing at the roots that scratched at our ankles.
            </span>

                As we grew ever closer to the heart, I hear a scream from my husband. I turned to see him fall to the floor and grip his foot in writhing pain. A tooth, about four inches long and razor sharp, had broken through the sole of this boot and buried itself into his foot. Dead weight, even if I could get the tooth out. I left him to wraith as I examined the trail ahead of us. Pearly white spikes led deeper into the forest.
