                We lived on the edge of the woods, woodcutters all of us. We were hard by, yes, but we hadn’t always been. Before the Blood Moon rose, we were in great demand. Everyone needed wood to warm their hearths, to cook, to purify. The sickening rust-colored glow of the eternal moon changed that.
            </span>
            <span class='span' id="s2" >
                There were no more hearths to warm, nothing left to cook, no chance left to purify. The forest we bit into for fuel bit us back.
            </span>
            <span class='span' id="s3" >
                Just as we were <a class="black-text hunger" href="hunger.html">hungry</a> for progress, it was <a class="black-text hunger" href="hunger.html">hungry</a> for what had been taken from it. Ever closer it crept. If you were foolish, you could hear its whispers on the wind. They spoke of lives in exchange for lives. For every tree felled, a soul sacrificed at it’s heart. The weak were dragged into the forest by strange roots, the strong said good bye to their families before walking into their eternal torment. That is what kept him up at night, the screams and the whispers and the <a class="black-text hunger" href="hunger.html">hunger</a>.
